# Biodiversity-Species_Analysis

e goal of this project is to analyze Biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.
This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the
analysis.
Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:

• What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
• Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
• Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
• Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?



# Analysis
In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:

1. Distributions
2. counts
3. relationship between species
4. conservation status of species
5. observations of species in parks.

Here are some of the results that we were able to derive based on our analysis.

1) distribution of species
